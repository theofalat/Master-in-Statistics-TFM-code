These are 5 identical files that each use the data of a different experimental set-up. The files are named Sx_xx_xx. The first number is the the swirler, or the geometry of the jet nozzle emitting the airflow
The second number is the airflow velocity 30, 50 etc.
The last number is the orientation of the jet nozzle in respect to the beamforming array: 0, 90 degs. 
The main working file is the one containing S0_30_90. It is the one that I used for the findings in my thesis.
